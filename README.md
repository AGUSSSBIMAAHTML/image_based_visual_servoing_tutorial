[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Now-blue.svg)](https://github.com/AGUSSSBIMAAHTML/image_based_visual_servoing_tutorial/releases)

## üìã Overview

This repository demonstrates **Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS)** applied to the **peg-in-hole task**. This task involves aligning a peg with a target hole with different shapes:

- **Pentagon Hole**: a non-circular target with sharp corners
- **Circular Rim Hole**: a standard round target with an elliptical image projection under tilt

This implementation is based on the methods described in **Chaumette, Hutchinson, and Corke (2016), "Visual Servoing"** found in the *Springer Handbook of Robotics*.
